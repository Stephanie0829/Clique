# Clique

Clique is an application meant to enhance the experience of social circles.

Its current implementation contains the following features:

* Profile - Create a profile and add/modify address, driving preferences, and availability
* Friends & Cliques - Add/remove friends and create/join/leave a Clique (friend group)
* Routing - Multiple addresses, driving/time constraints, indicate who a user will pick up or be picked up by, etc.
* Calendar - Automatic import from Google Calendar, priority lists, etc.

Clique leverages technology to resolve the issues that many groups face,
especially in terms of planning where and when to meet.
